			<h1> 2018-2019 UGA Football Season Outlook</h1>
			<p style="color:Purple;font-style: italic;">Following a stelluar year in Georgia football, the <B>Bulldogs</b> are out to seek 
			vengence and revenge. Following a heart-wrenching loss to Alabama in the final
			seconds of the BCS National Championship, the <B>Bulldogs</B> are back with a hunger
			for the title.Last season the Bulldogs went 13-2, a stellular record on its own, however 
			it serves as only the minimum for the <b>Bulldogs</b> in the 2018 season.If the dawgs want to be as dominant as they were last year, 
			there are major issues to acknowledge and fix. The biggest and most difficult one would be finding replacements for the dynamic duo 
			of Nick Chubb and Sony Michel. Both Chubb and Michael broke numerous records while at Georgia, therefore whoever replaces them, 
			expectations are high. Another major issue that needs fixing, is finding replacements from defensive MVP and Bullake Award winner Roquan Smith. 
			Smith lead the teams in tackles and was a leader on defense, making him very hard to replace. For the <b>Bulldogs</b> the 2018-19 
			season means winning it all or nothing. </p>

		<p style="color:Red;font-style: italic;">Luckily for the UGA <b>Bulldogs</b>, the task of winning it all is very doable given the current roster and recruiting class of 2019.
		Not only does UGA bring back 7 players on offense and 9 players on defense, they also have the number one recruting class in the nation. During
		the offseason Kirby Smart, managed to grab four 5 star recruits, ten 4 star recruits, and twelve 3 star recruits, giving UGA one of its best recruiting
		class in history. Both the remaining and upcoming roster are packed with talent, however that may not be enough.The biggest name from the freshman class, and possibly the 
		next playmaker we should all be watching goes by the name of Justin Fields. Justin is a the number two ranked quarterback in the nation and the top rank dual-threat qb. 
		All eyes will be on him next year as he tries to compete with sophomore quarterback Jake Fromm.

<P style="color:Blue;font-style: italic;">Here below is the daily week for an avergae UGA football player. As you can see everyday is specifically meant for a certain task. Kirby Smart works hard to ensure that
every player, regardless of anything, follows strictly to this schedule. Kirby has created a new culture in terms of Athens football, and this schedule helps to greatly reflect that.He expects
his players to not only follow the weekly schedule, but also to execute it to their ability. If players donâ€™t follow by the schedule, or miss a day in anyway, strict punishment is handed out by Kirby.Typically if 
a player misses one day, punishments tend to be physical, such as running after practice. However if multiple days are skipped or missed, Kirby has been known to suspend players from games, something no UGA player wants 
to miss out on.It is through Kirby's new system and tactics that has allowed UGA to grow into the powerhouse.
